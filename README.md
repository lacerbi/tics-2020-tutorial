# Tutorial on computational modeling and statistical model fitting

This tutorial is part the *Trends in Computational Neuroscience* graduate course of the University of Geneva (2020). The course instructor for this part of the course is [Luigi Acerbi](http://luigiacerbi.com/).

## Instructions

- Download the tutorial folder somewhere on your computer: [download](https://github.com/lacerbi/tics-2020-tutorial/archive/master.zip).
- To run the tutorial, you will need a standard scientific Python 3.x installation with Jupyter notebook (such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)). 
- You will also need the `CMA-ES` optimization algorithm (see [here](https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma)). You can install CMA-ES from the command line with `pip install cma`.
- Then open the Jupyter notebook `tics-intro-model-fitting-notebook.ipynb` (you should have *Jupyter notebook* installed as part of Anaconda).
- Slides of the lectures will be uploaded after the class, and instructions for the second mini-project related to this part of the course will be communicated after the second lecture.
- For any additional question, please email the course instructor at luigi.acerbi@unige.ch.
